import pandas as pd

# A DataFrame is a table.
# It contains an array of individual entries, each of which has a certain value.
# Each entry corresponds to a row (or record) and a column
# This is how we print dataset in pandas
x = pd.DataFrame({'Joy': ['I am Happy', 'I am excited'], 'Sad': ['I am not Happy', 'I am a sin']})
print(x)

# index give a name to the index count 0-ONE 1-two
y = pd.DataFrame({'Bob': ['I liked it', 'Its awful'], 'Sue': ['Its sweet', 'Its tasty']}, index=['one','two'])
print(y)

# A Series, by contrast, is a sequence of data values.
# If a DataFrame is a table, a Series is a list. And in fact you can create one with nothing more than a list:
z = pd.Series([1,2,3,4], index=['zero','one','two','three'], name='ProductA')
print(z)

# Read a csv file in pandas
wine_rev = pd.read_csv("WINEMAG.csv", index_col=0)

# HEAD will give first five rows
print(wine_rev.head())

# no of rows and columns 130,000 rows and 14 columns
print(wine_rev.shape)

# To save a Dataframe into a CSV
y.to_csv('csv1.csv')
